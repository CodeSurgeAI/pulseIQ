Master Application for Leadership team for Hospitals

## Hospital KPI Assistant

An embedded assistant appears in the top navigation near the notifications/user avatar. Click the chat bubble icon to open a panel that:

- Speaks in polite, leadership-friendly language
- Surfaces actionable guidance across three pillars: operational efficiency, patient care, and cost control
- Uses current dashboard KPIs, AI predictions, anomalies, and recommendations (mock data in demo mode)
- Lets you ask quick questions like “How do we cut readmissions?” or “What’s our current wait time?”

Implementation:

- UI component: `src/components/ai/kpi-assistant.tsx`
- Rule-based engine: `src/utils/kpi-assistant.ts`
- Integration point: `src/components/layout/topnav.tsx`
- Demo data: `src/utils/mock-data.ts`

No external LLM calls are made; responses are generated locally from KPIs and heuristics. Replace mock data with live API sources to make it real-time.
