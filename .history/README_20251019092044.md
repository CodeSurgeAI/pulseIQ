Master Application for Leadership team for Hospitals

## Hospital KPI Assistant

An embedded assistant appears in the top navigation near the notifications/user avatar. Click the chat bubble icon to open a panel that:

- Speaks in polite, leadership-friendly language
- Surfaces actionable guidance across three pillars: operational efficiency, patient care, and cost control
- Uses current dashboard KPIs, AI predictions, anomalies, and recommendations (mock data in demo mode)
- Lets you ask quick questions like “How do we cut readmissions?” or “What’s our current wait time?”

Implementation:

- UI component: `src/components/ai/kpi-assistant.tsx`
- Rule-based engine: `src/utils/kpi-assistant.ts`
- Integration point: `src/components/layout/topnav.tsx`
- Demo data: `src/utils/mock-data.ts`

No external LLM calls are made; responses are generated locally from KPIs and heuristics. Replace mock data with live API sources to make it real-time.

### Voice controls (optional)

The assistant supports voice input and can perform actions:

- Speak to ask questions or issue commands (e.g., “Open dashboard”, “Mark all notifications as read”).
- Toggle “Voice On” to hear answers via text‑to‑speech.

Supported commands out-of-the-box:

- Navigation:
	- “Open dashboard”, “Go to alerts”, “Open leaderboard”, “Open financial performance”, “Open patient flow”, “Open supply chain”, “Open workforce”
	- “Open KPI form” / “Submit KPI”
	- “Open settings”
- Notifications:
	- “Mark all notifications as read”
- Topics (handled via local Q&A):
	- “How do we reduce readmissions?”
	- “What’s our wait time and a quick fix?”
	- “Ways to control costs without hurting care?”

Note: Speech recognition relies on the browser’s Web Speech API (best supported in Chromium-based browsers). If unsupported, text chat remains fully functional.
